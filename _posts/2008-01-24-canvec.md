*There some rough [cheap mlb jerseys][1] code for downloading and merging data for the yukon and [Dark][2] surround at<a title="http://code.google.com/p/maphew/" href="http://code.google.com/p/maphew/" target="_top" rel="external nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/maphew/</a>, eventually the resultant processed and merged data will be placed online. No idea [cheap jerseys][3] when I’ll get around to that though. If you get to it first, please let me know, I have a place to host it. — <a title="oldsite/MattWilkie" href="http://www.yukongis.ca/oldsite/MattWilkie.html" rel="internal">MattWilkie</a>– 2008-01-24*

><cite>Someone at AAFC in Ottawa said that they use the Canvec base for all</cite>  
><cite>their maps. Is this the same as the NTDB base in the Yukon? Do you use it?</cite>

In the Yukon canvec is derived from the 50k ntdb, and thus similar. The main difference at this time lies in naming [cheap nfl jerseys][4] of the layers and their attribute structure. The geometry is nearly identical — provided you are using the free ntdb from <a title="http://ftp2.cits.rncan.gc.ca/pub/bndt/" href="http://ftp2.cits.rncan.gc.ca/pub/bndt/" target="_top" rel="external nofollow">http://ftp2.cits.rncan.gc.ca/pub/bndt/</a> and not the 50k ntdb from Yukon Government (including Dept of Environment). The 50k ntdb we are using, edition 2.x (might be ed3.0), [M.][5] is behind the current release, edition 3.1.

The main change from ed2 to ed3.1 is horizontal correction. Ed3.1 will align more closely to GPS and Landsat7 data. The attributes are [to][6] unchanged.

So the bottom line is: if you are working with GPS and remote sensing data, use Canvec. If you are working with Yukon Government, use our 50k ntdb. If you have to do both, flip [Valley][7] a coin and explain to the project manager what is lost by choosing one or the other.

I apologise for a complicated answer to a straightforward question, [lunginflammation][8] and for the state of ambiguity it places everyone who works with us in.

><cite> the feature catalogue does not have code “LX_2030019” listed in the appendix, yet 105p15</cite>  
><cite> has this layer in both <a href="http://www.yukongis.ca/2007/04/backdoor-to-us-seamless-national-elevation-data/">to</a> the GML and SHP distribution archives. Is the specification in error or is the datafile isnamed?</cite>

2-The <a title="oldsite/CanVec" href="http://www.yukongis.ca/oldsite/CanVec.html" rel="internal">CanVec</a> codification will be modified in the next release in January [Place][9] 2008.

Camp: Modify LX_2030019 to LX_2030009
