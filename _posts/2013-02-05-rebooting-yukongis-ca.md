**www.yukongis.ca** has been rather *<cough>dead<cough>* ...stale... for some time, which means it's well past time for a reboot! So let's do that. :) Articles deemed worth keeping are being copied piecemeal from the **[old site][1]**. Their date stamps reflect more or less when they were published there. (meta: the banner picture I'm using during the rebuild is courtesy of [eyebex][2] and L.P; also see <http://eyebex.smugmug.com/>) -matt
